- ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm LtSalty glad you are here
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Coding in general but my end goal is to learn as much stuff as i can for Data & Security.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently pivoting from my main studies as a Sound & Acoustics Engineer because i want to pursue my passion. I've been seft taught pretty much for 2 years now(currently on my second semester at a public uni as a Application Design Technician) and finished couple of seminars/courses related to mostly ecomm creation/frontend development
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via email. (will update socials soon) ltsaltycoding@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was playing video games pretty much my whole life (competing in tier 2 competitions mostly) and i've taught people on different concepts about multiplayer video games (Fps/Mobas) in order to help them improve!
